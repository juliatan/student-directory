Student Directory
=================

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled on the course at Makers Academy. There is the flexibility to save to and load student lists to/from different CSV files.

Directory structure
-------------------

* extra_ex_files => additional files that made up part of the project but are not relevant to the execution of the main directory.rb file
* old_pls_ignore => old workings with nothing of interest to see
* students.csv => first example file filled with first set of student data
* students-f1.csv => second example file filled with second set of student data

How to use
----------

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

There is the option of loading an existing CSV file directly (substitute FILENAME below with the name of the file you want to load).

```shell
ruby directory.rb FILENAME.csv
```
